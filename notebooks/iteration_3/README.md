## Solution Setup

The solution of the problem is using LSTM as based model.

Notes :
* The ramal package also in [here]() 

## Summary Results

In this iteration, we have tried several options and here is a comparison (currently, all of the model eval focus on one product):

| Model    |  loss  |  rmse  |    mse   |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| model1   | 0.4752 | 0.6893 | 118944.10 |
| model2   | 0.4535 | 0.6734 | 55129.25 |
| model3   | 0.4470 | 0.6686 | 53972.60 |
| model4   | 0.4531 | 0.6731 | 130984.53 |
| model5   | 0.4469 | 0.6685 | 88552.14 |
| model6   | 0.4489 | 0.6700 | 110937.82 |
| model7   | 0.4321 | 0.6573 | 66544.61 |
